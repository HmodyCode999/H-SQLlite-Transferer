## üí° The Story Behind

As a backend beginner I start working with SQLite databases in VS Code, I frequently needed to modify database structures and transfer data between different database files. The extensions available were limited, and when I found a promising desktop application, I discovered it had been discontinued and was no longer supported.

**The Problem:**
- Existing SQLite management tools were discontinued
- Available alternatives lacked Windows support
- Only Linux archives were accessible
- VS Code extensions couldn't handle complex data transfers

**The Solution:**
I built this comprehensive tool to fill the gap, providing:
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Intuitive command-line interface
- Automated and custom data transfer options
- Built-in database creation functionality

- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling with rollback capabilities

### üõ†Ô∏è Database Creation Tool
- **Interactive Database Builder**: Step-by-step database creation
- **Column Type Selection**: TEXT, INTEGER, REAL data types
- **Primary Key Management**: Automatic primary key assignment

## üéØ Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+ installed on your system
- SQLite databases to transfer (source and destination)

### Method 1: Direct Download
```bash
# Visit the link up for one-click installation
# No additional setup required
```

### Method 2: From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HmodyCode999/H-SQLlite-Transferer
cd sqlite-transfer-tool
python main.py
```

### Quick Start Guide

#### 1. Launch the Tool
```bash
python main.py
```

#### 2. Choose Operation Mode
- **Transfer existing databases**: Select if you have both source and destination databases
- **Create new database**: Build a new database from scratch
- **Exit**: Close the application

#### 3. Configure Paths
- **Same folder**: Databases in the script directory
- **Desktop locations**: Standard desktop or custom desktop folders
- **Custom paths**: Full path specification for any location

#### 4. Select Transfer Type
- **Auto Transfer**: Automatically matches columns with identical names
- **Custom Transfer**: Map columns with different names between databases

#### 5. Execute Transfer
- Review settings in the validation screen
- Confirm and execute the transfer
- Monitor progress and success status

## üîÆ Advanced Features

### Smart Column Handling
```python
# Automatic ID column management
if 'id' in common_columns:
    print("NOTE: Ignoring 'id' column to allow automatic generation.")
    common_columns.remove('id')
```

### Multi-Table Support
- Automatic single-table detection
- Manual table selection for complex databases
- Table validation and error prevention

### Error Recovery System
```python
except sqlite3.Error as e:
    print(f"An SQL error occurred: {e}")
    if new_conn:
        new_conn.rollback()  # Prevent partial transfers
```
